# NofHoursUser
Level one - Create a program that asks the user for their name and the number of hours they have worked in a day, then display their name and calculate the number of hours worked in a week

Algorithm :

-	First it asks for name input and stores it in name
-	Second it asks for name initials and stores it in Letters
-	Third it asks for the number of hours per day and stores it in hoursPerDay
-	Fourth it asks for the number of days worked in a week and stores it in numDays
-	Then it multiplies the hours worked per day by the number of days worked in a week
-	Finally it prints out a greeting with the name of the user inputted
-	On a second line it states the first initials of the name inputted above
-	If ran without debugging it asks for another user input to close the program

Answer Example - answer1.cpp
